# AI Stock Predictions Configuration
# ==========================================

# Data Source: Controls how market data is fetched
dataSource:
  timeout: {{dataSource.timeout}} # Timeout in milliseconds for API requests
  retries: {{dataSource.retries}} # Number of attempts for failed network calls
  rateLimit: {{dataSource.rateLimit}} # Delay (ms) between symbols to avoid rate limiting

# Training: Controls the synchronization and skip logic
training:
  minNewDataPoints: {{training.minNewDataPoints}} # Only retrain if at least this many new points are available

# Model: Neural network architecture and hyperparameters
model:
  windowSize: {{model.windowSize}} # How many past days the model uses to predict the next day
  epochs: {{model.epochs}} # Maximum number of training cycles
  learningRate: {{model.learningRate}}
  batchSize: {{model.batchSize}} # Larger batch size improves training speed on modern CPUs

# Prediction & Reporting: Controls forecasts and visual output
prediction:
  days: {{prediction.days}} # Number of future days to forecast
  historyChartDays: {{prediction.historyChartDays}} # Days shown in the full history chart (5 years)
  contextDays: {{prediction.contextDays}} # Actual days shown in the prediction chart for context
  directory: '{{prediction.directory}}' # Destination directory for HTML reports
  buyThreshold: {{prediction.buyThreshold}} # Price increase threshold to trigger a BUY signal
  sellThreshold: {{prediction.sellThreshold}} # Price decrease threshold to trigger a SELL signal
  minConfidence: {{prediction.minConfidence}} # Minimum required model confidence for a valid signal
